    <p>Plants are living organisms that play a crucial role in our ecosystem. They belong to the kingdom Plantae and are characterized by their ability to produce their food through a process called photosynthesis. Plants are found in various habitats, ranging from forests and grasslands to deserts and aquatic environments. They come in diverse forms, including trees, shrubs, herbs, ferns, mosses, and more.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Points about Plants:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Plants are primary producers and form the basis of food chains.</li>
      <li>They release oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, which is essential for supporting life on Earth.</li>
      <li>Plants provide habitats and food sources for various organisms.</li>
      <li>They contribute to the water cycle and help prevent soil erosion.</li>
      <li>Plants have medicinal properties and are used for producing drugs and medicines.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Types of Plants:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Trees: Tall, woody plants with a single main stem called a trunk.</li>
      <li>Shrubs: Shorter than trees with multiple stems branching from the base.</li>
      <li>Herbs: Non-woody plants with soft stems and die down to the ground after flowering.</li>
      <li>Ferns: Flowerless plants with feathery leaves called fronds.</li>
      <li>Mosses: Small, non-vascular plants that grow in dense clumps.</li>
      <li>Lichens: Symbiotic organisms consisting of a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium.</li>
      <li>Cacti: Succulent plants adapted to arid environments with spines instead of leaves.</li>
      <li>Orchids: Flowering plants known for their vibrant and diverse flowers.</li>
    </ol>
